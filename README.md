This repository contains the code and visualizations from my Bachelor's thesis at the Institute of Statistics (Chair of Statistical Methods and Econometrics) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The thesis explores various neural network architectures for probabilistic electricity price forecasting, including parametric and non-parametric methods to model the output distribution. It includes hyperparameter optimization using the Optuna package, prediction generation, ensemble prediction building with various combination methods, and model evaluation through RMSE, MAE, and CRPS. Additionally, it features Probability Integral Transform (PIT) histograms and permutation importance to assess feature significance.
